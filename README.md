# Thread Help
    <p>
        A thread is a sequence of instructions within a program that can be executed independently of other code. Threads allow programs to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, enhancing performance and responsiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the context of this application, threads are utilized to draw objects concurrently on the canvas, providing a responsive user interface.

    <h2>How to Implement Threads</h2>
    <p>
        To implement threads in Python using the tkinter library, follow these steps:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Create a function for the task you want to perform concurrently.</li>
        <li>Use the threading module to create a new thread, passing the function as the target.</li>
        <li>Start the thread using the <code>start()</code> method.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>
        Here's an example of implementing threads in the provided Python application:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
import threading

def draw_object():
    # Your drawing logic here

# Create a thread
thread = threading.Thread(target=draw_object)

# Start the thread
thread.start()
    </code></pre>
    <h2>Running the Python Application</h2>
    <p>
        To run the Python application, follow these steps:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Ensure you have Python installed on your system. If not, download and install Python from <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">here</a>.</li>
        <li>Install the required Python libraries by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
            <pre><code>pip install tkinter pillow tkhtmlview</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>Save the Python code provided in a file with a <code>.py</code> extension, for example, <code>drawing_app.py</code>.</li>
        <li>Run the Python file by executing the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
            <pre><code>python drawing_app.py</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>The application window should now open, allowing you to interact with it.</li>
    </ol>
